Web Portfolio App


Creating my portfolio website was a challenging yet rewarding experience that helped me improve my web development skills. I decided to use Angular, a popular JavaScript framework, to build my website because it offers many powerful features for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

To start, I learned how to use Angular's command-line interface (CLI) to quickly generate a new project and create components for my website. I also used the Angular Material library to add pre-built UI components and styles to my website, which saved me a lot of time and effort.

Next, I used JavaScript and TypeScript to implement dynamic features such as form validation, animations, and data binding. I also used Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, to add responsive design and layout to my website.

Throughout the development process, I encountered many challenges, such as debugging errors, optimizing performance, and ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices. However, I learned a lot from these challenges and was able to overcome them by using best practices and seeking help from online resources and forums.

Overall, creating my portfolio website using Angular, JavaScript, and Bootstrap was a great learning experience that helped me improve my web development skills and build a professional online presence.
